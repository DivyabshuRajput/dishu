# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

# Membership Operators
Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

# Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
